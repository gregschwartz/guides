# Better Presentations
#### From “PowerPoint Hell” to “Powerful PowerPoint”

## Set up your presentation
* Open your master slide (instructions [PowerPoint](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/video-use-slide-masters-to-customize-a-presentation-055c0629-bf35-426a-bd19-5f0780fbc9af), [Keynote](https://www.lynda.com/Keynote-tutorials/Work-master-slides/5034163/3503480-4.html), [Google Slides](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5XWMioTapk)) then update these parts: 
  * Background: dark. e.g. black, dark blue, dark green, etc
  * Text: bright, which contrasts with background (e.g. white) 
  * Content’s font size: 30+ pt
  * Title: bold, smaller than content’s size
  * Content and text: sans-serif font
  * Update all sub-templates of the master (if there are any)
* If you haven't already, save the master slide as a template (instructions [PowerPoint](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028667/powerpoint-create-a-slide-master-in-powerpoint), [Keynote](https://support.apple.com/guide/keynote/create-and-manage-keynote-themes-tanb343cb739/mac), [Google Slides](https://business.tutsplus.com/tutorials/make-google-slides-template--cms-29864))

## On each slide
* One thing per slide
  * 100 slides of short content are better than 10 slides full of content
  * Discussing parts of a whole are ok -- e.g. a slide about pizza might say that pizza has crust, tomato sauce, toppings, etc
  * Use separate slides for details about parts, e.g. types of crust
* Do you need to show all the points?
  * Could you simply mention them verbally and again in notes?
* If you need details: show one point at a time, and highlight it
  * Only show 1st point, explain it, then add 2nd point to screen
  * Example colors for highlighting
    * Current point: white
    * Previous points: medium gray (#535353)
* Explaining a process, table, visualization, or other graphic form:
  * Show first step/column/etc, explain it
  * Show next step/column, explain it
  * Repeat until you’ve displayed the whole table/process/visualization
  * Too many parts to show all at once? Group and then zoom in:
    * Show process grouped into parts, without details of each part (e.g. birth, childhood, teenager, adult, senior)
    * Zoom into each part and explain it
    * Zoom out to show whole process
    * Repeat
* Look at each point -- can it be shown graphically?
  * Emoji / icons 
  * Graphs
  * Photographs
* Try. Removing. Every. Word. 
  * Read the sentence out loud while skipping the 1st word
    * If it still makes sense, remove the 1st word
  * Repeat with the 2nd word, 3rd word, etc
  * It may feel very repetitive, but as you build this habit you can easily cut half the words out!
  
## Post-presentation content
* If your presentation is meant to consumed by people reading/watching later
  * Make notes from the presentation content
    * Switch to Outline View in [PowerPoint](https://nutsandboltsspeedtraining.com/powerpoint-tutorials/outline-view-in-powerpoint) or [Keynote](https://support.apple.com/guide/keynote/change-the-working-view-tanae4979928/mac), copy text to your notes, then add anything else you need (e.g. details you said instead of putting on the slides)
  * Share a recording of the presentation
* If presentation has requests/assignments (e.g. please fill out X, John leads team Y)
  * A follow-up email with them might be enough, you might not need full notes
* If presentation contains significant details (e.g. code samples)
  * Make notes focusing particularly on those details
