# Better Presentations
#### From “Powerpoint Hell” to “Powerful PowerPoint”

Thank you for watching! Here’s a checklist to apply what you learned.

## Set up your presentation
* Open your master slide. Instructions: PowerPoint, Keynote, Google Slides
  * Dark background (e.g. black, dark blue, dark green, etc)
  * Text: bright color, which contrasts with background (e.g. white) 
  * Content’s font size: 30+ pt
  * Title: bold, smaller than content’s size
  * Content and text be a sans serif font
  * Update all sub-templates of the master (if there are any)
* Make notes from the presentation content.<br />
Tip: you may be able to open your presentation in Outline mode and copy all the text into your notes, then cut the text down in your presentation.

## For each slide:
* One thing per slide
  * 100 slides of short content are better than 10 slides full of content
  * Discussing parts of a whole are ok -- e.g. a slide about pizza might say that pizza has crust, tomato sauce, toppings, etc
  * Use separate slides for details about parts, e.g. types of crust
* Do you need to show all the points?
  * Could you simply mention them verbally and again in notes?
* If you need details: show one point at a time, and highlight it
  * Only show 1st point, explain it, then add 2nd point to screen
  * Example colors for highlighting
    * Current point: white
    * Previous points: medium gray (#535353)
* Explaining a process, table, visualization, or other graphic form:
  * Show first step/column/etc, explain it
  * Show next step/column, explain it
  * Repeat until you’ve displayed the whole table/process/visualization
  * Too many parts to show all at once? Group and then zoom in:
    * Show process grouped into parts, without details of each part (e.g. birth, childhood, teenager, adult, senior)
    * Zoom into each part and explain it
    * Zoom out to show whole process
    * Repeat
* Look at each point -- can it be shown graphically?
  * Emoji / icons 
  * Graphs
  * Photographs
* Try. Removing. Every. Word. 
  * Read the sentence out loud while skipping the 1st word
    * If it still makes sense, remove the 1st word
  * Repeat with the 2nd word, 3rd word, etc
  * It may feel very repetitive, but as you build this habit you can easily cut half the words out!
